## 👋 Hi, I'm Rahul Menon

I'm a Data Science professional passionate about building impactful, real-world AI systems — from classical machine learning to cutting-edge Generative AI.

### 🚀 What I Do
- Develop and deploy end-to-end ML and GenAI applications using tools like **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **vector databases** (Qdrant, FAISS).
- Architect **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines and context-aware AI agents for complex problem solving.
- Build scalable, serverless infrastructure using **AWS (Lambda, ECS Fargate, API Gateway, S3, SQS)**.
- Create multimodal systems combining **image, video, and text** data for use cases like mental health diagnostics.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
**Python**, **TensorFlow**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **SQL**, **Scikit-Learn**, **NLP**, **LLM Fine-tuning**, **Prompt Engineering**, **LangChain**, **RAG**, **AWS**, **CI/CD**, **Data Visualization**

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Autonomous AI agents with memory and tools
- Scalable GenAI pipelines for real-world tasks
- RAG optimization & LLM evaluation
